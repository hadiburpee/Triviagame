# Triviagame

This is a trivia game.  I used an array with objects to store the questions and separate functions to reset, change questions, click evaluation. 

The player will open the game and be presented with a click to start game.  Once they start, they will be playing in the game in an endless loop.  The game keeps track of your score, which is affected by guessing correctly, incorrectly and if the timer runs out.
